# TitanPanel Currency – Krowi’s

This addon plugs right into Titan Panel to give you a clear view of your gold and currencies. It tracks across all your characters, shows session gains and losses, and lets you decide exactly how much detail you want on your bar or in tooltips.

## Core Features

### Multiple Display Modes

Pick what you want to see on your Titan Panel bar:

- **Character Gold** – Just the money on your current toon  
- **Current Faction Total** – Totals for all your Alliance or Horde characters  
- **Realm Total** – Everything on your current realm  
- **Account Total** – All characters across every realm plus Warband Bank  
- **Warband Bank** – Only the shared account‑wide bank balance  

### Advanced Tooltips

Switch between three tooltip styles with simple key presses:

- **Money Tooltip** – Shows each character’s gold, sorted by wealth, plus faction totals and session info  
- **Currency Tooltip** – Lists all currencies, grouped and sorted neatly  
- **Combined Tooltip** – Both money and currencies together in one view  

**Smart Controls:**

- Hold `Shift` or `Ctrl` to flip between tooltip types  
- Hints adjust depending on your default tooltip setting  
- Input is throttled so it runs smoothly without lag  

### Session Tracking

Keep an eye on your gold flow while you play:

- **Flexible Duration** – Track anywhere from 1 to 48 hours  
- **Data Persists** – Survives reloads and game restarts  
- **Auto‑Extend** – Keeps going as long as you’re active  
- **Live Updates** – Records every change (loot, trades, repairs, mail, etc.)  
- **Quick Reset** – Toggle tracking off to clear the data instantly  

### Character Management

See the bigger picture across all your toons:

- **Multi‑Realm Support** – Works across every realm you play on  
- **Faction Split** – Separate totals for Alliance and Horde  
- **Class Colors** – Characters shown in their class color for easy spotting  
- **Smart Sorting** – Richest characters float to the top automatically  
- **Active Character Highlight** – Green marker shows which one you’re on  
- **Warband Bank Included** – Shared account balance counted in totals

### Interface Options
